Hi, my name is Levi Goodbar and I am a recent Associates graduate wanting to learn more about coding and programing. I have mild experience with MATLAB and am trying to start the beginning stages of the Python language from videos on youtube. I appreciate feedback and insight to learn more about this skill. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
